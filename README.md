## I’m just a programmer 🎀

This is a personal multitool I'm building in Python, based on ideas that come to mind and the things I'm learning along the way.

Any help or constructive feedback is truly appreciated—nobody is born knowing everything!

**Hope you like it :)**


## Features ⚙️

So far, I've built a Python module that performs network scans using Scapy.


## Future Ideas 💡

I'm thinking about adding features like encryption/decryption tools or different types of shells.

But for now, my focus is on improving the scanning functionality as much as possible.


## Documentation 📜

I’ll try to document the code as clearly as I can. This is my first “big” project, so I’m learning as I go.

For now, I’ll be adding comments in the code and including a **readme.txt** in each important section of the project.
